# Deep-Docking-NonAutomated

Deep docking (DD) is a deep learning-based tool developed to accelerate docking-based virtual screening. Using NVIDIA's own Autodock-GPU,  one can screen extensive chemical libraries like ZINC15 (containing > 1.3 billion molecules) {how much faster is it than just docking?} times faster than typical docking. For further details into the processes behind DD, please refer to our paper (https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.0c00229).
